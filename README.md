# Capstone project #1 : Divvy Bike

## Description of the Capstone project #1 
The Capstone project is the hands-on project to be completed at the end of the Google course for Data Analysis Professional Certificate.

You can bring this project as far as you want to.

In this case, we have used some the tools presented in the course, <span style="color:blue">Google Sheets and R</span>, We have left aside SQL and Tableau. We have also limited the data to 1 month (April 2022). It's always better to start small to build the process and if satisfying to exapnd it to larger amount of data. We think we were able to come up with a pertinent approach. To expand it to larger volumes requires a different set of tools capable of hosting laerge volume. We think that the besat tool is either ELK or SQL + Tableau on GCP BigQuery or R on Spark.

We will present at a later stage such implementations. Our goal is to ultimately offer different types of implementation for DAta Analysis projects by our Open Source project turned into our Context22 start-up.

## Divvy Bike Chicago
Divvy is a bike sharing system managed by the City of Chicago.

## Data Set 
Provided by Divvy Bike

## Approach
Despite the project providing an high level requirement document, we prefer the approach to get the data and get whatever insights we can. We avoid setting a direction and limiting the meaning the data have.
