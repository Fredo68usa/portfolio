## Dell Twitter Sentiments
- DellEmojiTwitter.xlsx : Data and computation. In particular, I made a pretty cool double pivot table  that produced a meaningful distribution of the users. This distribution is a Pareto one, something we have seen many times before. This distribution can/should be taken into consideration when analysing the sentiments, since it can be hypothesized that the frequency of twetting may be a good indication of the user engagement. We expect their assertive to grow with their engagement. To be tested.
